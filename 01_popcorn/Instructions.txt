INSTRUCTIONS:
Implement a method named "countPops"
and also write a method named "tester"
to test the correctness of countPops.
Call tester for a variety of test cases
and display out a final score for the
correctness of countPops.

The countPops method takes an integer
array as input. The method will
repeatedly read a value from the array,
starting at index zero, go to the 
position indicated by the value, read
the value at THAT position, then go
there, and so on until a limit of 100 is
reached or the index is out of bounds.

The first value should be read from
the array at index 0.

The method must return an integer
count of how many times it read a
value from the array.

Here are some examples:

INPUT: {1,3,0,5}
OUTPUT: 3
The method reads 1 from index 0
The method reads 3 from index 1
The method reads 5 from index 3
The method identifies that index 5
is out of bounds and returns 3 to
indicate that 3 values were read
from the array.

Here's another example:

INPUT: {4,-1,0,5,2,8,-2}
OUTPUT: 100
The method reads 4 from index 0
The method reads 2 from index 4
The method reads 0 from index 2
The method reads 4 from index 0
...
The method repeats up to a limit
of 100 times and returns 100.

Here's another example:

INPUT: {3,-1,4,2,5,-2}
OUTPUT: 5
The method reads 3 from index 0
The method reads 2 from index 3
The method reads 4 from index 2
The method reads 5 from index 4
The method reads -2 from index 5
The method identifies that index -2
is out of bounds and returns 5 to
indicate that 3 values were read
from the array.

Here is a list of correct input/output
pairs:
INPUT              OUTPUT
{1,3,0,5}            3
{4,-1,0,5,2,8,-2}  100
{3,-1,4,2,5,-2}      5
{3,-1,4,2,5}         4
{}                   0

The tester method takes an array of
inputs to test and an expected output
count as input. Tester calls countPops
and compares countPops's return value
to the expected output value. If
countPops is correct, tester returns 1
if countPops is incorrect, tester
returns 0.

Finally, in main, call tester for each
of the test cases and add up the score.
Display out the final score in main like
this:
    System.out.println("Your output is "+score+" out of 5.");
